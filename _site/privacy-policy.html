Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases, including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect information.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD </h2><p>You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.

If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> SECURITY </h2><p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Firm. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. Our Firm cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to the Firm over the Internet.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> SEVERABILITY </h2><p>Each paragraph of this Privacy Policy shall be and remain separate from and independent of and severable from all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or indicated by the context of the agreement.

Any amendments to this Policy shall be deemed as accepted by the User on their continued use of the Platform.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING </h2><p>As a responsible firm, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> CONSENT WITHDRAWAL, DATA DOWNLOAD & DATA REMOVAL REQUESTS </h2><p>To withdraw your consent, or to request the download or delete your data with us for any or all our products & services at any time, please email to care@hwtests.com.</p><h2 class="common-h2"> CONTACT US </h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, you should contact us by sending an e-mail to please email to care@hwtests.com.
