                        <p>Image splitting refers to the option or a feature that divides the image/photo according to the requirement of the user. In technical terms, it is called “Image segmentation” and is defined as the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.</p>
