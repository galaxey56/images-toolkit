A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. There are many applications to a QR code, but most of all it is in storing information of large volumes in a small square block, the users can scan the code and can access the info whenever needed."
