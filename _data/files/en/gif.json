{"Format":"GIF","ShortName":"GIF","FullName":"Graphical Interchange Format File","Category":"Raster Image Files","Pros":"The file size is little. Images that appear to be professional. Better Message Conveyance Transparency is favoured.","Cons":"Pattern with a limited colour palette. It is not possible to edit. It Is Important To Have A Good Internet Connection.","Createdby":"CompuServe","CreatedbyLink":"https://www.compuserve.com/","CreatedInYear":"1987","BasicInformation":"A GIF file is a graphic file that has been stored in the Graphical Interchange Format (GIF) (GIF). It can have up to 256 indexed colours and a colour palette that can be a predefined set of colours or customised to the image's colours. GIF files are kept in a lossless format, which means that the image's sharpness is not affected by GIF compression.","DetailedInformation":"Because of its ability to move images, GIF is the most used image file type on the internet. GIFs are a popular web graphics format, particularly for small images and images with text, such as navigation buttons. JPEG (.JPG) images, on the other hand, are better for displaying photos since the number of colours they may display is not limited. GIF images can be animated and stored as \"animated GIFs,\" which are frequently used on websites to display rudimentary animations. They may also contain translucent pixels, allowing them to blend in with a variety of colour backgrounds. However, unlike a.PNG image, pixels in a GIF image must be either entirely transparent or fully opaque, therefore transparency cannot be faded.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Edge","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200","image":"/assets/fileimg/2DVHHaP.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Photos","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/nrsG7Ys.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Photo Viewer","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/photo-viewer-for-windows-10-ff861e89-d4a7-146d-19d0-1b117b94ffc2","image":"/assets/fileimg/FSHZ7pW.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Paint","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-microsoft-paint-a6b9578c-ed1c-5b09-0699-4ed8115f9aa9","image":"/assets/fileimg/AuNqAKT.jpeg"},{"name":"Adobe Illustrator 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/16q77H1.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Safari","link":"https://www.apple.com/safari/","image":"/assets/fileimg/PePZ5cb.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Preview","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/preview/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/O1HqazZ.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2021","link":"https://www.coreldraw.com/en/product/coreldraw/purchase.html?AID=10816204&PID=3081440&cjevent=51885051cce111eb80d1d3470a180510&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharpened+Productions&x-vehicle=cj","image":"/assets/fileimg/cfwD39J.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Adobe Illustrator 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/16q77H1.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]}]}
