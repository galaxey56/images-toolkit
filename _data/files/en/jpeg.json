{"Format":"JPEG","ShortName":"JPEG","FullName":"Joint Photographics Expert Group","Category":"Image file format","Pros":"A very popular format. Compression at a high, controlled level resulting in a small file size. format is compatible and displays correctly in all browsers, text, and graphics programs, on all computers, tablets, and mobile devices. Supports full-color realistic images with a lot of color and contrast transitions. High quality of image with a small degree of coherence.","Cons":"When you compress the image, it may “fall apart” into individual squares - 808-pixel blocks. This occurs because the compression algorithm analyses neighboring pixels. smooth color – transitions may become harsh or simply vanish. JPEG is less suitable for working with text or monochrome graphics with clear boundaries. This format does not support transparency even though it is required when creating templates, logos, and buttons. The image's quality declines with each subsequent compression step.","Createdby":"ITU-T and Joint Photographics Expert Group","CreatedbyLink":"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2009-2012/Pages/16/jpeg1x.aspx","CreatedInYear":"1992","BasicInformation":"A JPG file is an image saved in the Joint Photographic Experts Group's compressed image format (JPEG). It is widely used for storing digital photos and is supported by most digital cameras. JPG files are among the most commonly used image formats. It's a common technique for compressing photography photos. JPEG is also the name of the file format that uses this type of compression. Lossy compression is irreversible, and the lower the compression rate, the sharper the image.","DetailedInformation":"There was no technology in the early 1980s that allowed people to readily compress and exchange digital photos. In 1982, the JPEG workgroup began developing a compression standard to reduce the size of image files while maintaining as much quality as possible, making them easier to share. The JPEG file format was designed by the workgroup in 1992. JPEG files, which are usually saved with the.jpg or.JPEG extension, are images generated utilizing a lossy compression process that destroys some of the data in the source image file. This data loss, however, is generally undetectable to the naked eye. JPG files are ideal for final products, while lossless files are best for editing. The JPEG standard is still the most popular image compression format in use today because it allows users to create sharable, high-quality image files and because it is so deeply embedded in technology used to make and exchange photos.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Edge","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200","image":"/assets/fileimg/2DVHHaP.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Shotwell","link":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell","image":"/assets/fileimg/wJy7aoh.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"Microsoft Photos","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/nrsG7Ys.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Photo Viewer","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/photo-viewer-for-windows-10-ff861e89-d4a7-146d-19d0-1b117b94ffc2","image":"/assets/fileimg/FSHZ7pW.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft OneDrive","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage","image":"/assets/fileimg/BV8ML15.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Microsoft Paint","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-microsoft-paint-a6b9578c-ed1c-5b09-0699-4ed8115f9aa9","image":"/assets/fileimg/AuNqAKT.jpeg"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Preview","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/preview/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/O1HqazZ.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"ACD Systems ACDSee Photo Studio for Mac","link":"https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/photo-studio-mac/","image":"/assets/fileimg/kXyPDCs.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop Express","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mny97V6.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Microsoft OneDrive","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage","image":"/assets/fileimg/BV8ML15.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft OneDrive","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage","image":"/assets/fileimg/BV8ML15.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"File Viewer for Android","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sharpened.androidfileviewer","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Chrome OS","link":"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"}]}]}
