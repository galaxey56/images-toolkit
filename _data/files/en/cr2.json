    "BasicInformation": "A raw camera image created by various Canon digital cameras is known as a CR2 file. It saves uncompressed picture data in the same format as the CCD. CR2 files are commonly used by professional photographers because they store higher-quality photos.",
    "DetailedInformation": "The Canon Raw version 2 format, which is based on the TIFF specification, is used to save CR2 files. CR2 photos can be created by a variety of Canon digital camera types, including the EOS 1D Mark IV, EOS 450D, and EOS Rebel T3. It transfers data from the sensor to the storage device directly. It cannot be seen in the same way that a JPG or PNG can. When photographs are saved in RAW format, they can be manipulated in considerably more detail in post-production with minimal quality loss. When using JPG or other image formats, the quality is drastically reduced. CR2 images aren't ready for printing yet, and they can't be modified with a bitmap editor. Raw photographs are analogous to film negatives in digital form.",
