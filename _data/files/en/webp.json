{"Format":"WEBP","ShortName":"WEBP","FullName":"Web Picture","Category":"Raster Image Files","Pros":"File sizes are smaller. Compression algorithm has been improved. Color gradients that are smoother. Masking the alpha channel.","Cons":"Browser support is lacking. Interface for exporting is poor. Artifacting appears to be made of plastic.","Createdby":"Google","CreatedbyLink":"https://developers.google.com/","CreatedInYear":"2010","BasicInformation":"A WEBP file is a raster image format developed by Google for web graphics called WebP (pronounced \"Weppy\"). The WebP format compresses files more efficiently than typical JPEG compression while preserving image quality that is comparable to or greater than that of JPEG. Similar to.PNG, it enables lossy and lossless compression and contains an alpha channel for transparency.","DetailedInformation":"The open standard WEBP picture format, created by Google in 2010, allows users to save photos in both lossy and lossless compression. The compression efficiency, according to Google developers, allows photos to be shrunk to sizes up to 34% less than JPEG and PNG images while maintaining great quality. The WebP format is based on On2 Technologies' technology, which was purchased by Google in 2009. The format, which was announced in 2010, uses a container based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Except for Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer, most web browsers accept WEBP files as of 2019. The hypothesis is that by using the technology used to make WEBP images (assuming widespread adoption), the internet as a whole can be sped up because WEBP images require less storage space, allowing bigger quantities of images to be viewed simultaneously at higher speeds around the world.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"WebP Codec","link":"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download","image":"/assets/fileimg/NY9GTXm.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"ImageMagick","link":"https://imagemagick.org/index.php","image":"/assets/fileimg/hJWCII5.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Edge","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200","image":"/assets/fileimg/2DVHHaP.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"WebP Codec","link":"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download","image":"/assets/fileimg/NY9GTXm.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"ImageMagick","link":"https://imagemagick.org/index.php","image":"/assets/fileimg/hJWCII5.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Chrome OS","link":"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"}]}]}
