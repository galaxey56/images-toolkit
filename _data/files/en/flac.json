{"Format":"FLAC","ShortName":"FLAC","FullName":"Free Lossless Audio Codec","Category":"Audio file","Pros":"Excellent audio quality in a tiny file size. Many systems are compatible with it. Source code is open and licence is free. Hardware assistance (PhatBox, Kenwood MusicKeg, Rio Karma, etc.) available. Support for streaming. Decoding is really quick. Multichannel and high-resolution feeds are supported. Replay Gain is supported. Supports the use of a cue sheet (with some limitations) As a replacement to Shorten, it's gaining popularity.","Cons":"Other prominent current compressors (Monkey's Audio, LPAC, OptimFROG) compress more efficiently. Higher compression options are sluggish and provide minimal improvement over the default setting.","Createdby":"Xiph.Org Foundation","CreatedbyLink":"https://www.xiph.org/","CreatedInYear":"2001","BasicInformation":"The acronym FLAC refers to the Free Lossless Audio Codec. FLAC is a lossless MP3 format. FLAC is most commonly used in classical music, where sound quality is critical. FLAC has grown fairly popular as a result of its sound quality. FLAC files can now be played in your favourite player (or in your vehicle or home stereo) exactly like MP3 files.","DetailedInformation":"FLAC is an audio compression format developed by members of Xiph.org. The compression is lossless, which means that no data is lost and no quality is sacrificed. FLAC allows users to save files at their original media quality, making it excellent for backing up audio data because tangible copies of audio files are prone to destruction. FLAC is a widely adopted format that decreases the size of digital audio by about 60% and is generally supported across the most major platforms. The Xiph.Org Foundation created the format, which is open source. Along with the FLAC file, a FLAC Fingerprint file, which comprises the filename and checksum information for the FLAC file, can be generated. FLAC files are frequently used for real-time streaming and decoding. The FLAC project is made up of several components, including a stream format, a container format, an encoder and decoder reference library, and input plugins.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"aTunes","link":"http://www.atunes.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/U6hLUgu.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg"},{"name":"Adobe Audition CC 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/SJ29L8A.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"aTunes","link":"http://www.atunes.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/U6hLUgu.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Adobe Audition CC 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/SJ29L8A.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Videolan VLC for mobile","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/rawD7q8.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Golden Ear","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/golden-ear/id407945101?ign-mpt=uo%3D8","image":"/assets/fileimg/upbts7y.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Moliplayer","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moli-player-hd-free-movie-music-player-for-network/id598886783?ign-mpt=uo%3D8","image":"/assets/fileimg/FAo0QEL.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Videolabs VLC for Android","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/TnwKQd9.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"jetAudio","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jetappfactory.jetaudio","image":"/assets/fileimg/jcTagMw.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Chrome Beta version","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
