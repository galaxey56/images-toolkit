    "BasicInformation": "The AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) extension is a sound data storage standard for a variety of electronic audio devices. It includes high-resolution audio that has been preserved in an uncompressed, lossless format. AIFF files can also be saved in the format. Files ending in.AIFC are known as AIF files (if they are compressed).",
    "DetailedInformation": "Apple used Electronic Art's Interchange File Format to produce it in 1988. (IFF). AIFF files are uncompressed (lossless) and substantially larger than the popular MP3 files, which are compressed and lossy. Loop information and sound samples are both possible in AIFF files. AIFF files are widely seen on MAC OS machines. Professional musicians who value the high quality of the files and can handle the hefty storage requirements are the most common consumers of AIFF files. Despite minor differences in storage mechanism and little difference in quality, several varieties of AIFF files are frequently stored under the same file extension. AIFF files, unlike.MP3 and many other common audio files, are uncompressed. AIFF files often include higher-quality audio than equivalent MP3 files since their data is not compressed. However, because the files contain more data, they take up more storage space.",
