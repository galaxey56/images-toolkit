{"Format":"HEIC","ShortName":"HEIC","FullName":"High Efficiency Image Format","Category":"Raster Image Files","Pros":"Great quality of images. Takes up less storage. Can store multiple images in one file. Can alaso store image derivations.","Cons":"Not compatible with all systems and devices. Not very popular. Has issues with patent. ","Createdby":"Moving Picture Experts Group","CreatedbyLink":"https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/","CreatedInYear":"2001","BasicInformation":"One or more photographs stored in the High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), a file format most typically used to save photos on iOS devices, are contained in a HEIC file. It comprises an image or series of images, as well as metadata characterising each image, that was most likely created using the Camera app on an iPhone or iPad. HEIC files are usually saved as.heic files, although they can alternatively be saved as.HEIF files.","DetailedInformation":"HEIF, or H.265, is a digital picture storage standard that retains photos at a higher quality and in lower files than the. JPEG is a digital image format. This saves space on memory cards and mobile devices by reducing the size of photos. Apple introduced HEIF the default photo storage format for iOS devices with the release of iOS 11 in 2017. As a result of this adjustment, iPhones and iPads began saving users' images as HEIC. With the introduction of High Sierra, Apple enabled HEIF compatibility to both iOS and macOS. Google extended HEIF support to Android in 2018, and Microsoft brought HEIF support to Windows in 2018. Users must explicitly instal the Microsoft HEIF Image Extensions and HEVC Video Extensions packages from the Microsoft Store in order to open HEIC files in Microsoft apps. When you export or share a photo taken using the Camera app on an iOS device to a non-iOS device or application, it is usually converted from a HEIC format to a JPEG or.JPG file.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Adobe Premiere Rush","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/WBNj13N.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Photos with HEIF Image Extensions and HEVC Video Extensions packages installed","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-Tcw4tJawHA2VbfUU47cFuA&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-Tcw4tJawHA2VbfUU47cFuA&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xurhnaenupuk000%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-Tcw4tJawHA2VbfUU47cFuA%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xurhnaenupuk000","image":"/assets/fileimg/nrsG7Ys.jpeg"},{"name":"TunesBro HEIC Converter","link":"https://www.tunesbro.com/heic-converter.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/7eQehmc.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Preview","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/preview/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/O1HqazZ.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"TunesBro HEIC Converter","link":"https://www.tunesbro.com/heic-converter.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/7eQehmc.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Dropbox","link":"https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2","image":"/assets/fileimg/ovQYI78.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Adobe Premiere Rush","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/WBNj13N.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Adobe Premiere Rush","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/WBNj13N.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Dropbox","link":"https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2","image":"/assets/fileimg/ovQYI78.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Simple Soft Alliance Luma: HEIF Viewer and Converter","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=luma.hevc.heif.image.viewer.converter","image":"/assets/fileimg/1o2rNBD.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"HEIC Image Viewer Decoder","link":"https://speedtesting.herokuapp.com/heicviewer/","image":"/assets/fileimg/KXTzTK7.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
