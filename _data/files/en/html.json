{"Format":"HTML","ShortName":"HTML","FullName":"Hypertext Markup Language File","Category":"Web file","Pros":"HTML is a commonly used language. HTML is supported by all browsers. It's simple to learn and utilise. HTML is a light-weight and quick-loading language. You do not need to purchase any software.","Cons":"Because it is a static language, it cannot produce dynamic output on its own. The structure of HTML documents is becoming more difficult to comprehend. Errors can be expensive. It takes a long time. HTML has a limited set of security measures.","Createdby":"Tim Berners-Lee at CERN","CreatedbyLink":"https://home.cern/","CreatedInYear":"1989","BasicInformation":"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that is used to format the structure of a webpage. It's saved in a standard text format and contains tags that specify the webpage's layout and content, such as the text, tables, images, and hyperlinks. HTML files are often used on the internet and may be viewed in web browsers.","DetailedInformation":"The standard for constructing websites is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at CERN, proposed the idea in 1989. Web browsers can read this language and translate it into different texts, colours, forms (headings, paragraphs, quotations, and other semantics), hyperlinks, and URL embedding to insert images or audio. HTML components are used to construct the structure of webpages in the markup language. Each element typically contains an opening tag enclosed in angle brackets (tag>) and a closing tag enclosed in angle brackets but preceded by a forward slash (/tag>).Users can see the HTML coding by going to their browser's \"View Source\" tab. HTML can be used to format the text of a document in some email applications. Although HTML and XHTML are similar, they are not the same.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"W3C Amaya","link":"https://www.w3.org/Amaya/","image":"/assets/fileimg/e9cgmZo.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"KompoZer","link":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/","image":"/assets/fileimg/8aN9yEj.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Notepad","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-notepad/9msmlrh6lzf3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/82vepge.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Wordpad","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-xMQ4Sl1Ik8DLCMUAH94NdQ&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-xMQ4Sl1Ik8DLCMUAH94NdQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xurkqpvnupuk000%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-xMQ4Sl1Ik8DLCMUAH94NdQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xurkqpvnupuk000","image":"/assets/fileimg/Kp0egqG.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"KompoZer","link":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/","image":"/assets/fileimg/8aN9yEj.jpeg"},{"name":"Microsoft Visual Studio Code","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com/","image":"/assets/fileimg/51PJjGr.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"W3C Amaya","link":"https://www.w3.org/Amaya/","image":"/assets/fileimg/e9cgmZo.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Visual Studio Code","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com/","image":"/assets/fileimg/51PJjGr.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"KompoZer","link":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/kompozer/","image":"/assets/fileimg/8aN9yEj.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Fornace Espresso HTML","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/espresso-html/id487303069?ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/t2WljZe.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Alexander Blach Textastic Code Editor","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/d5byEov.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome Text","link":"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text/mmfbcljfglbokpmkimbfghdkjmjhdgbg","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Opera","link":"opera.com","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mt9PAUF.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
