    "BasicInformation": "An OGG file is a compressed audio file that uses Ogg Vorbis audio compression, which is free and unpatented. It's comparable to an MP3 file, except it sounds better than an MP3 file of equal size, and it may include song metadata such as creator and track info. Several software music players, as well as some portable music players, handle OGG files.",
    "DetailedInformation": "The Ogg container is a file format for storing audio data. The name \"Vorbis\" refers to an encoding technique developed by Xiph.Org, the same company that created Ogg. Other methods of audio compression, such as FLAC and Speex, may be present in OGG files. Nevertheless, because they use a different compression algorithm, these files cannot be legally referred to as \"Vorbis\" files. It enables users to view and edit high-resolution digital multimedia files. The term \"Ogg\" comes from the jargon term \"ogging.\" In the game Netrek, ogging refers to a suicide run that kills a carrier. The OGG extension was once used to describe any file that used the OGG container format, but it was only used for Ogg Vorbis audio files after 2007. The OGG extension can be used to refer to an audio file, but it can also be used to refer to a container file.",
