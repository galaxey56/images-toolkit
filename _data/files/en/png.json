{"Format":"PNG","ShortName":"PNG","FullName":"Portable Network Graphics","Category":"Bit-map image graphics format","Pros":"Compression loss is kept to a bare minimum. Any compression ratio has no effect on the image quality. The format is excellent for storing intermediate versions of the image. The quality of an image is not lost when it is re-saved. PNG supports a huge number of colors. It allows for multiple levels of transparency. The ability to work with layers. The ability to add to the file meta-data. The size of the files is small.","Cons":"Unsuitable for working with full-color photographs. Can't save many images in a single file. Doesn't allow animation.","Createdby":"PNG Development Group","CreatedbyLink":"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/","CreatedInYear":"1996","BasicInformation":"An image file saved in the Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format is known as a PNG file. It contains a lossless compressed bitmap, comparable to that of a .GIF file. Web graphics, digital pictures, and images with translucent backgrounds are typically saved as PNG files. Originally, the PNG image format was intended to replace the GIF image format because they both support transparent backgrounds. The usage of indexed colors and lossless compression is another similarity between the two. PNG files, on the other hand, are not subject to the same copyright restrictions.","DetailedInformation":"Overlayed upon a checkered background is a PNG image with an 8-bit transparency layer (top) (bottom). PNG employs deflation, a non-patented lossless data compression technique. PNG can compress images more efficiently than GIF in most cases, but some implementations use inadequate filter methods, resulting in needlessly huge PNG files. There are three types of transparency in the PNG format- one for indexed, color images, and two for greyscale or true-color images. Gamma values, background color, and textual content are all image attributes that can be recorded in PNG files. The standard allows for up to 16 bits per channel, however, most customers only need 8 bits per channel. For saving images, the PNG format is widely used, especially on the internet. It can handle 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA (RGB with a fourth alpha channel) color images that are indexed (palette-based). Full-color, non-indexed RGB or RGBA photos, as well as grayscale images, are supported by the format. PNG files may be encountered by a variety of computer users, whether they are downloading an image from a website, receiving a digital photo attached to an email, or taking a screenshot. For web use, graphic designers frequently save graphics as PNG files. They also employ PNG files to save translucent logo or icon mockups that can be overlaid over other pictures.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Edge","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=4LioSo*jxMc&ranSiteID=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&epi=4LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200%29%287593%29%281243925%29%284LioSo.jxMc-8cApDvsVIlYVzCtlYhBrpQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_ubj0vvercgkfqjqvkk0sohzzz32xuukxg3nupsf200","image":"/assets/fileimg/2DVHHaP.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"Microsoft Photos","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/nrsG7Ys.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Photo Viewer","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/photo-viewer-for-windows-10-ff861e89-d4a7-146d-19d0-1b117b94ffc2","image":"/assets/fileimg/FSHZ7pW.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Paint","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-microsoft-paint-a6b9578c-ed1c-5b09-0699-4ed8115f9aa9","image":"/assets/fileimg/AuNqAKT.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Paint 3D","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/7Z9sNdy.jpeg"},{"name":"ACD Systems ACDSee","link":"https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/photo-studio-home/","image":"/assets/fileimg/acdsee.png","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Preview","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/preview/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/O1HqazZ.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Safari","link":"https://www.apple.com/safari/","image":"/assets/fileimg/PePZ5cb.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft OneDrive","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage","image":"/assets/fileimg/BV8ML15.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop Express","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mny97V6.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Pixelmator 2","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/HmizpGb.jpeg","type":"Paid"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer for Android","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Microsoft OneDrive","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage","image":"/assets/fileimg/BV8ML15.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop Express","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mny97V6.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Chrome OS","link":"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"}]}]}
