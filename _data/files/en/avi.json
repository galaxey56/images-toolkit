{"Format":"AVI","ShortName":"AVI","FullName":"Audio Video Interleave File","Category":"Video file","Pros":"Remarkably excellent audio quality fidelity. There are numerous codecs that can be employed to reach the appropriate ratio while compressing files online. Because it was created by Microsoft, it can be played on all major Microsoft and non-Microsoft operating systems. Unlike other audio/video formats, the DV-AVI standard can be compressed. It does not necessitate the use of any specific hardware or software. Because of its compressing capabilities, the AVI video format is the most often used for promos, short films, and advertising. For master files, the quality retained with AVI is good.","Cons":"Many people become frustrated when they can't find the codec from a safe, reputable source. Users may find the break in their experience undesirable even when those sources are available. When compared to other file formats, AVI files can be quite huge if they are not compressed. When you compress an AVI file online above specific limits, the video quality suffers. User interaction is not supported. Does ot support softsubs.","Createdby":"Microsoft","CreatedbyLink":"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/","CreatedInYear":"1992","BasicInformation":"An AVI file is a video file stored in the Microsoft-created Audio Video Interleave (AVI) multimedia container format. It holds video and audio files encoded in a variety of codecs, including DivX and XviD. AVI files can be played using a variety of video players, including Microsoft Movies & TV, Windows Media Player, and Apple QuickTime Player, all of which come pre-installed with their respective operating systems.","DetailedInformation":"The AVI format is based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), a container format for storing multimedia that was first released in 1991. Microsoft created the AVI format a year later in 1992, and it is still widely used today. It is supported by a wide range of video players, however in order for the video to play successfully, the player must support the codec used to encode the video data.To support simultaneous playback, AVI combines audio and video into a single file in a common container. Its advantage is its simple architecture, which allows it to function on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Macs, Linux, and Unix, and is supported by all major web browsers.It can store high-quality video and audio and utilises less compression than other video formats like.MPEG and.MOV.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Xine","link":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/xine/","image":"/assets/fileimg/11To9CR.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Kodi","link":"https://kodi.tv/","image":"/assets/fileimg/XLdMM90.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Media Player","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player-d10303a5-896c-2ce2-53d4-5bd5b9fd888b","image":"/assets/fileimg/XYvKzO9.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Microsoft Movies and TV","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/movies-tv/9wzdncrfj3p2?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/fVyIEs4.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg"},{"name":"Kodi","link":"https://kodi.tv/","image":"/assets/fileimg/XLdMM90.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple QuickTime Player","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/5hGiNf7.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Kodi","link":"https://kodi.tv/","image":"/assets/fileimg/XLdMM90.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Adobe Premiere Pro 2020","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/RUVWLwB.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Eltima Elmedia Player","link":"https://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/H7CZmss.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Videolan VLC for mobile","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/rawD7q8.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"olimsoft Oplayer","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oplayer-video-player/id344784375?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/Xa1wjEf.jpeg","type":"Paid"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Videolabs VLC for Android","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/TnwKQd9.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"BIT Labs Simple MP4 Video Player","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.br.com.bitlabs.VideoPlayer&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/P6WGAMN.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]}]}
