{"Format":"SVG","ShortName":"SVG","FullName":"Scalable Vector Graphics File","Category":"Vector Image file","Pros":"Size is pretty small. It is flexible i.e. you may instantly alter the graphics settings on the site using CSS, such as the background colour or the logo's location on the page. Scalability does not deteriorate image quality. Provides browser support.","Cons":"If the object contains a significant number of little elements, the file size grows very quickly. It's impossible to read just a portion of a graphic thing, you have to read the complete object, which slows you down.","Createdby":"Adobe Systems","CreatedbyLink":"https://www.adobe.com/in/","CreatedInYear":"2001","BasicInformation":"SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is a two-dimensional vector graphics file format based on XML. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) designed it in 1999 as a standard format for presenting vector images on the Internet. It uses an XML-based text format to describe images. SVG files are being developed as a web standard for displaying vector graphics.","DetailedInformation":"The SVG format is an open standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with Adobe playing a key role. Adobe Creative Suite products like Illustrator and GoLive can produce and export SVG pictures. SVG allows users to search, index, script, and compress pictures, enabling for interactivity and animation. Because SVG files are XML files, text editors can access, generate, and edit them, however drawing software is the most typical creator of this file type. Lossless data compression is possible with SVG files. They support text as well as raster and vector graphics. SVG is an XML standard that defines vector-based graphics for internet use. The image quality is unaffected by zooming and resizing. SVG files can be animated in all of its components and sections. W3C standards (including DOM and XSL) are included with SVG files that are recommended by W3C. Vector pictures, such as those with the SVG file format, are made up of predetermined sets of forms, which allows for crisper images when zoomed and scaled.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Inkscape","link":"https://inkscape.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/69oMRM0.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"KolourPaint","link":"http://kolourpaint.sourceforge.net/","image":"/assets/fileimg/3JbciOH.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Inkscape","link":"https://inkscape.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/69oMRM0.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg"},{"name":"Adobe Illustrator 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/16q77H1.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Inkscape","link":"https://inkscape.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/69oMRM0.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"GIMP","link":"https://www.gimp.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/wcqHWtb.jpeg","type":"Free "},{"name":"Adobe Illustrator 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/16q77H1.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","link":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/","image":"/assets/fileimg/WofJU7C.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
