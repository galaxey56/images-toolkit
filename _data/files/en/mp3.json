{"Format":"MP3","ShortName":"MP3","FullName":"MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III","Category":"Audio file","Pros":"Accepted extensively by all. Practically all hardware audio players and gadgets support it. Very high rates of compression offered. Can be decoded pretty fast, and in a more sophisticated manner. An ISO standard that is part of the MPEG specifications. Anyone can put their own version together with the available demo sources. The licensing requiremnets are relaxed. It provides support to multichannel files. ","Cons":"Performance and efficiency are lower than current codecs. The maximum bitrate (320kbps) isn't always enough.There are no multichannel implementations available yet. Incompatible with high-definition audio (sampling rates higher than 48kHz). Causes increase in music piracy due to greater availability and ease of use.","Createdby":"Moving Picture Experts Group","CreatedbyLink":"https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/","CreatedInYear":"1987","BasicInformation":"An MP3 File format is a compressed audio file that uses \"Layer 3\" audio compression. It was produced by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) (MP3). Audio recordings, podcasts, soundtracks, sermons, audiobooks, lectures, etc are all widely stored as MP3 files.","DetailedInformation":"MPEG released the MP3 format in 1993, after developing it in the early 1990s. It could condense audio to a fraction of the size of other common audio file types at the time (about 1/10 the size of an uncompressed.WAV or.AIF file). So, this format quickly became the standard for storing music and rose above the other existing ones. At that time, computers provided very less storage space. So, the deveopment of the MP3 format was a very critical event. Currently, MP3 is the most used audio file format. The file size of a multimedia file can be greatly decreased with MPEG compression, with minimal detectable loss in quality. This improves the efficiency of file transfers over the Internet. In the 1990s and 2000s, MP3 technology revolutionized the concept of recorded music streaming by allowing people to more simply and quickly download music from the internet.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"XMMS","link":"http://www.xmms.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/hodO9zz.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Amarok","link":"https://amarok.kde.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/Dh0nFk6.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Clementine","link":"https://www.clementine-player.org/about","image":"/assets/fileimg/F87GDJM.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Media Player","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player-d10303a5-896c-2ce2-53d4-5bd5b9fd888b","image":"/assets/fileimg/XYvKzO9.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg"},{"name":"Apple itunes","link":"https://www.apple.com/itunes/","image":"/assets/fileimg/rElyIoV.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Adobe Audition CC 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/SJ29L8A.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Apple Music","link":"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/","image":"/assets/fileimg/rElyIoV.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Audacity","link":"https://www.audacityteam.org/","image":"/assets/fileimg/c5Zl0O1.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Roxio Toast","link":"https://www.roxio.com/en/products/toast/titanium/?AID=10860394&PID=3081440&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharpened+Productions&cjevent=5cfb7817c9d211eb8386155e0a18050c","image":"/assets/fileimg/vyEg9wb.jpeg","type":"Paid"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Music","link":"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/","image":"/assets/fileimg/rElyIoV.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"olimsoft Oplayer","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oplayer-video-player/id344784375?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/Xa1wjEf.jpeg","type":"Paid"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"antvplayer Media Converter","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AndroidA.MediaConverter&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/qwnEy06.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Chrome OS","link":"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
