    "Pros": "Allows for faster data transmission via several channels. Sound quality tests reveal that it restores the original sound more efficiently at various bitrates and sampling rates. Ensures consistent performance in a variety of situations. A future-oriented structure for numerous telecom services. Adaptive to the sound information type. Can partially compensate for quality losses during transmission, allowing for continuous live data transfer with no interruptions. ",

    "BasicInformation": "Opus is a new codec produced by a team of experts from the Xiph.Org Foundation (Mozilla Corporation) and Skype Technologies S.A. (Microsoft). It has all of the advantages of MP3 while minimising its flaws. Opus combines the codecs CELT and SILK.",
    "DetailedInformation": "An OPUS file is a lossy audio file created in the Opus format (sometimes known as \"Ogg Opus\"), which was designed for Internet streaming. It supports varying bit rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s and employs both SILK (used by Skype) and CELT (from Xiph.Org) codecs. Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and in-game chat all employ the Opus codec. The IETF defined the Opus format, which is widely used. The IETF standardised the Opus format, which is maintained by Xiph.Org. Because the Opus codec is mostly used for streaming, files with the.opus extension are uncommon.",
