It has one or more tracks that contain various sorts of media data, including video, audio, and text (subtitles). Movies and other video files are typically saved as MOV files.",
    "DetailedInformation": "Apple developed and released QTFF in 1991. The container format is intended to support a variety of media formats in order to facilitate the transmission of multimedia between devices, operating systems, and applications. QTFF multimedia files are often stored as.mov files, however they can also be saved as.qt files. Video, audio, timecode, and text tracks can all be found in MOV files, which can be used to store and synchronise various forms of data. Several alternative codecs can be used to encode each media track. The MPEG-4 codec is often used to compress MOV files. Each file container can hold a variety of media kinds. Videos, video effects, text, photos, subtitles, and audio can all be stored in them. This file type is frequently used by video editing applications. MOV and QuickTime files are frequently used in music and video editing (or the two combined).",
