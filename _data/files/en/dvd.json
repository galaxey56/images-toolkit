    "BasicInformation": "DVD files are used as drivers for MS-DOS-based devices. These driver files allow a computer or other device to communicate with the operating system, in this instance MS-DOS. They may come preconfigured with Windows or require installation from a DVD included with the hardware.",
    "DetailedInformation": "DVD files are frequently confused with video files that contain a copy of a movie on a disc. The movie files are normally saved as VOB files, despite the fact that the media is named a DVD. The drivers and DVD files are sometimes already installed on Windows. However, the drivers may need to be manually installed on occasion. This is usually done with the help of a disc or other medium that came with the device. On their websites, several companies also give driver downloads for their products.",
