{"Format":"NEF","ShortName":"NEF","FullName":"Nikon Electronic Format RAW Image","Category":"Camera Raw Files","Pros":"When human computer processing is required, NEF files are more beneficial. This opens up a lot of possibilities for improving image quality, which isn't possible with JPEG files. Because the original pixel data is preserved in NEF files, the image quality is substantially better. They are either compressed using lossless techniques or are not compressed at all. JPEG and TIFF photos have a narrower tone range and colour precision than NEF images.","Cons":"Because NEF files are substantially larger than JPEG files, there are fewer of them that can be saved on a card. This is also why it takes a Nikon camera longer to save RAW files to a memory card. There are numerous RAW file formats, and experts are having difficulty defining a unified RAW file standard. Nikon has also been chastised for employing noise reduction, which has been shown to degrade image quality.","Createdby":"Nikon","CreatedbyLink":"https://www.nikon.co.in/","CreatedInYear":"n/a","BasicInformation":"A raw photo taken with a Nikon digital camera is saved as a NEF file. It's saved in the Nikon Electronic Format (NEF), which saves data in the same uncompressed format as the CCD. Image metadata, such as the camera ID and lens used, is also included in NEF files. The metadata includes details about the lens, its settings, the camera, and more.","DetailedInformation":"NEF files are most commonly used by Nikon shooters. These photographers may be professionals or amateurs who use Nikon cameras to capture photographs and save the raw data as NEF files. Raw files are photos that haven't been processed, printed, or edited with bitmap graphics editors yet. The raw file tries to replicate the scene as nearly as possible, including the lighting, intensity, and colours. The data captured by the camera's sensor is recorded in raw data pictures. NEF files can be saved in either an uncompressed or lossless compressed format on a camera memory card. NEF files are similar to \"digital negatives.\" Despite the fact that there is no debate about the image quality of NEF files, software developers do not choose this format owing to the lack of a common standard.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"Corel AfterShot Pro 3","link":"https://www.aftershotpro.com/en/?x-clickref=1011lhbytYH4&utm_source=pz&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1100l45633&x-vehicle=pz","image":"/assets/fileimg/mSrHgSp.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Photos","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/nrsG7Ys.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Nikon ViewNX2","link":"https://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/software/viewnx2/","image":"/assets/fileimg/pgXaxjb.jpeg"},{"name":"Corel AfterShot Pro 3","link":"https://www.aftershotpro.com/en/?x-clickref=1011lhbytYH4&utm_source=pz&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1100l45633&x-vehicle=pz","image":"/assets/fileimg/mSrHgSp.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Preview","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/preview/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/O1HqazZ.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop 2021","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/fClLkgM.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Nikon ViewNX2","link":"https://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/software/viewnx2/","image":"/assets/fileimg/pgXaxjb.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Corel AfterShot Pro 3","link":"https://www.aftershotpro.com/en/?x-clickref=1011lhbytYH4&utm_source=pz&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1100l45633&x-vehicle=pz","image":"/assets/fileimg/mSrHgSp.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop ","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop/id1457771281","image":"/assets/fileimg/xeDZX8x.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Snapseed","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/p5rWIzT.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop Express","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile&hl=en_IN&gl=US","image":"/assets/fileimg/Mny97V6.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "},{"name":"Google Snapseed","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_US","image":"/assets/fileimg/p5rWIzT.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Photos","link":"https://www.google.com/photos/about/","image":"/assets/fileimg/xbfyrdU.jpeg","type":"Free  "}]}]}
