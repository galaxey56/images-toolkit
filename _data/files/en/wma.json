    "Format": "WMA",
    "ShortName": "WMA",
    "FullName": "Windows Media Audio File",
    "Category": "Audio file",
    "Pros": "So far, Microsoft has published eight editions of WMA, with editions following WMA 7 supporting certificate encryption in order to safeguard music copyrights, which musicians and music publishers may profit the most from. WMA may compress audio at a greater rate, allowing it to store high-quality audio while using less space.",
    "Cons": "When you compress audio with the WMA codec, you usually lose some quality. WMA is far from perfect for consumers who care about sound quality, but they can choose FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) or APE (commonly known as monkey's audio) instead. Microsoft owns the WMA standard and refuses to share it with other companies.",
    "Createdby": "Microsoft",
    "CreatedbyLink": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/",
    "CreatedInYear": "1999",
    "BasicInformation": "A WMA file is an audio file saved in Microsoft's proprietary Advanced Systems Format (ASF) format. It includes Windows Media Audio as well as metadata elements such as the track's title, artist, album, and genre. WMA files are similar to MP3 files in that they are typically used to stream music via the internet.",
    "DetailedInformation": "This file format was created to compete with the well-known MP3 and RealAudio formats. The popularity of WMA files for usage with video playback on DVD players as well as video playback features on mobile/portable devices for Playstation and Nokia contributed to their success. Although most WMA files are lossy, some formats allow for lossless compression. ASF is a proprietary digital music and video container format developed by Microsoft. It utilises the if it contains Windows Media Video rather than Windows Media Audio. WMV is a video format extension. WMA and WMV files are interchangeable. However, ASF files are more often utilised.
