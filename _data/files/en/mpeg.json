{"Format":"MPEG","ShortName":"MPEG","FullName":"Moving Pictures Experts Group Video","Category":"Video file","Pros":"MPEG files give excellent outcomes that are exact replicas of their originals. Most online browsers support this format, and it may be played on a variety of platforms, including Windows Media Player and QuickTime.","Cons":"Despite the high quality of MPEG's end products, this results in a poor compression ratio and a bigger file size. It may take longer to open a larger file.","Createdby":"Moving Picture Experts Group","CreatedbyLink":"https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/","CreatedInYear":"1993","BasicInformation":"An MPEG file is a video file that employs the Moving Picture Experts Group's standardised digital video format (MPEG). It contains compressed video and audio using MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 compression. Typically, MPEG files are used to exchange videos over the Internet.","DetailedInformation":"The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is an international organisation that develops media compression and encoding standards. Most significantly, MPEG establishes video and audio compression standards. MPEG-1, the first version of MPEG video and audio compression, was released in 1993. MPEG-2, the successor to MPEG-1, was created in 1995. The lossy compression allows for reduced file sizes to be downloaded and uploaded while maintaining good quality. These audio and video file containers keep the two portions in sync while being compressed using MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 compression. .MPG files can be used to save MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 films. MPEG films are increasingly being saved as.MP4 files, which use MPEG-4 compression.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Media Player","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player-d10303a5-896c-2ce2-53d4-5bd5b9fd888b","image":"/assets/fileimg/XYvKzO9.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Nullsoft Winamp","link":"http://www.winamp.com/","image":"/assets/fileimg/38J4iOl.jpeg"},{"name":"Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate","link":"http://www.xilivideo.com/video-converter-ultimate.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/Cc9amsH.jpeg","type":"Free trial"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple QuickTime Player","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/5hGiNf7.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Eltima Elmedia Player","link":"https://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/H7CZmss.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Roxio Toast 18","link":"https://www.roxio.com/en/products/toast/titanium/?AID=10860394&PID=3081440&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharpened+Productions&cjevent=5cfb7817c9d211eb8386155e0a18050c","image":"/assets/fileimg/V2G1SGL.jpeg","type":"Paid"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Videolan VLC for mobile","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/rawD7q8.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Pentaloop PlayerXtreme Media Player","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playerxtreme-media-player/id456584471?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/uoX9gqI.jpeg","type":"Freemium"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"Videolabs VLC for Android","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/TnwKQd9.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"antvplayer Media Converter","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AndroidA.MediaConverter&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/qwnEy06.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
