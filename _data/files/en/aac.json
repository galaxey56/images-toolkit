    "Format": "AAC",
    "ShortName": "AAC",
    "FullName": "Advanced Audio Coding File",
    "Category": "Audio file",
    "Pros": "Nowadays, more devices are aware of AAC. Encoded file sizes are less. The goal of standardisation has been met. Sound quality is superior to MP3. The product is widely available. Streaming Bandwidth is Limited. Compatibility with a wide range of devices. A wide range of encoding options are available.",
    "Cons": "It takes a long time to encode. During the encoding process, the CPU is heavily used. During decoding, the CPU usage is slightly higher. File Organization Has Become More Complicated. Even though it's less, it's still a loser. Hardware Support is limited. Tagging Files Isn't Always Compatible. It Might Be Too Expensive to Encode AAC from Lossless Original Files. MP3 is still considered more \"standard\" than AAC.",

    "BasicInformation": "For audio coding at medium to high bit rates, AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is the logical successor to MP3 (ISO/MPEG Audio Layer-3) (ISO/MPEG Audio Layer-3). This compressed audio format is comparable to an MP3 file, however it has a few performance advantages. Higher coding efficiency for both stable and transient signals, a smaller filter bank, and improved handling of frequencies beyond 16 kHz are just a few examples.",
    "DetailedInformation": "Apple iTunes and the iTunes Music Store employ Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) as the default encoding. The AAC algorithm's concept is to use two basic coding schemes to drastically minimise the amount of data required to transmit high-quality digital audio. AAC files have more sample frequencies than MP3 files, as well as up to 48 channels, superior coding and filter bank efficiency, and better transient signal coding accuracy. AAC files, like MP3 files, remove audio frequencies that the human ear cannot process, resulting in smaller, more manageable files. AAC files are substantially less than MP3 files in terms of file space.",
