{"Format":"MP4","ShortName":"MP4","FullName":"MPEG-4 Part 14","Category":"Video file","Pros":"Offers multi-platform support. Easy to use. Easily distributable. Compression at a high level while creating smaller files, which makes it perfect for video streaming or compressing high-definition audio-video files. Can content metadata. Can be integrated with 3D graphics and other tools to interact. Supported by all platforms. A versatile file format.","Cons":"Codec difficulties might cause audio to drift out of sync with the video. Playback and editing may necessitate a significant amount of computational power. Because it is a lossy format, a higher degree of compression and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality reductions. Because of its popularity, copyrighted files can now be illegally distributed.","Createdby":"Moving Picture Experts Group","CreatedbyLink":"https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/","CreatedInYear":"2001-2003","BasicInformation":"MPEG4 is a file format for storing media types defined by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group, while it can also store other media types. .mp4 is the most common extension for this type of file. It's a type of multimedia file used to save a movie or video clip. It could also include graphics or subtitles. MP4 is an abbreviation for MPEG-4 Part 14 (MPEG-4), a container format based on the QuickTime File Format (QTFF), which is utilised by.MOV and.QT files.","DetailedInformation":"MP4 files employ the Moving Picture Experts Group's MPEG-4 compression standard (MPEG). The audio and video tracks are compressed separately in this format. The video is compressed using MPEG-4 video encoding, and the audio is encoded using AAC compression, which is the same as that used in.AAC files. Apple and other mobile device manufacturers frequently utilise this file type to store audio, still photos, or video. Audio books, songs, movies, videos, pictures, and podcasts are all examples of this. MPEG-4 is a popular video streaming format. Many MP3 players claim to be able to play MP4 files, which basically implies they can play music and some video files (albeit not always true MP4 files). The MP4 extension allows you to download or stream movies, videos, and audio files.","Softwaresused":[{"platform":"Linux","softwares":[{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"HandBrake","link":"https://handbrake.fr/","image":"/assets/fileimg/jsU9KjR.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Windows","softwares":[{"name":"File Viewer Plus  â€”  Get it from Microsoft","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/file-viewer-plus-4/9nmsdkxc9r3f?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab","image":"/assets/fileimg/QdcouPN.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows Media Player","link":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player-d10303a5-896c-2ce2-53d4-5bd5b9fd888b","image":"/assets/fileimg/XYvKzO9.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg"},{"name":"HandBrake","link":"https://handbrake.fr/","image":"/assets/fileimg/jsU9KjR.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"Mac","softwares":[{"name":"Apple QuickTime Player","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac","image":"/assets/fileimg/5hGiNf7.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"MPlayer","link":"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/IKdU9NN.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"HandBrake","link":"https://handbrake.fr/","image":"/assets/fileimg/jsU9KjR.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Roxio Toast 18","link":"https://www.roxio.com/en/products/toast/titanium/?AID=10860394&PID=3081440&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Sharpened+Productions&cjevent=5cfb7817c9d211eb8386155e0a18050c","image":"/assets/fileimg/V2G1SGL.jpeg","type":"Paid"}]},{"platform":"iOS","softwares":[{"name":"Apple Music","link":"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/","image":"/assets/fileimg/rElyIoV.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Apple Photos","link":"https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/","image":"/assets/fileimg/b18tt3b.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"VideoLan VLC Media Player","link":"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html","image":"/assets/fileimg/99jo0FJ.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"olimsoft Oplayer","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oplayer-video-player/id344784375?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4","image":"/assets/fileimg/Xa1wjEf.jpeg","type":"Paid"}]},{"platform":"Android","softwares":[{"name":"File viewer for Android","link":"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/","image":"/assets/fileimg/6uyiajm.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Videolabs VLC for Android","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/TnwKQd9.jpeg","type":"Free"},{"name":"Adobe Premiere Rush","link":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red","image":"/assets/fileimg/WBNj13N.jpeg","type":"Free trial"},{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"BIT Labs Simple MP4 Video Player","link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.br.com.bitlabs.VideoPlayer&hl=en","image":"/assets/fileimg/P6WGAMN.jpeg","type":"Free"}]},{"platform":"ChromeOS","softwares":[{"name":"Google Drive","link":"https://www.google.com/drive/","image":"/assets/fileimg/bC8ZzSs.jpeg","type":"Freemium"},{"name":"Chrome OS","link":"https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ZTI2NTv.jpeg","type":"Free, included with OS"},{"name":"Google Chrome","link":"https://www.google.com/chrome/","image":"/assets/fileimg/ffv3iNy.jpeg","type":"Free"}]}]}
