    "Pros": "Movies, online presentations, banner adverts, Internet animations, and other uses for Flash are just a few examples. Over 90% of website visitors will be able to see it. Flash files are often small and straightforward to download. Flash may be seen on both broadband and dial-up connections, as well as on older, slower systems. A wide range of video files can be converted to the Flash format with ease.",
    "Cons": "It can be costly and time-consuming to create Flash content. Because search engine spiders do not identify Flash files, they do not contribute to site optimization. When accessing a web page featuring Flash, visitors may encounter lengthier wait times, especially if they are using a dial-up connection.",

    "BasicInformation": "A video file saved in the Adobe Flash Video (FLV) container format is known as a FLV file. A short header, synchronised audio and video data streams (encoded in the same way as streams in the standard Flash.SWF format), and metadata packets are all stored.",
    "DetailedInformation": "Adobe Systems' Flash Video Format is widely used for online videos on sites like YouTube, Hulu, Vevo, and a variety of other streaming video services. Adobe Flash Player (including browser plug-ins) and third-party software can read and watch FLV files on nearly every operating system (with the exception of iOS). With the release of Adobe Flash Player 7 in 2003, the FLV format was launched. Adobe Flash Player primarily uses it to offer online video content such as movies and TV episodes. FLV, on the other hand, is an open format that is supported by a variety of non-Adobe/ Macromedia apps. The Flash Video Exporter plug-in (available with Adobe Animate) or any programme that supports FLV files can be used to produce Flash Video content and export it as FLV files. With Adobe Media Encoder, users may now encode various video formats such as QuickTime or Windows Media. As online technologies advanced in the 2010s, Flash's flaws, which included performance and security vulnerabilities, became increasingly apparent. Adobe and numerous online browser makers formally stopped support for Flash on December 31, 2020, as the use of Flash Player and the FLV format plummeted.",
